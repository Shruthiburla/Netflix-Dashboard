I have collected the data set from the Kaggle related to Netflix , i imported the dataset to the tableau  ,analysed it and created some visualizations related to the movies , TV shows , generations, ratings etc.
Created an interactive dashboard about the entire information about the particular movies.
Tableau makes visualization easy.
The ratio of movies is greater then the tv shows.
The count of movies and tv shows are widely increased from 2018.
